# Stabilizer_Scars_Data
Data used in plots for "Stabilizer Scars" by J. Hartse, L. Fidkowski, and N. Mueller

The data from the main text is in the folder "main", and the data from the supplemental material is in the folder "supplemental_material". In the "main" and "supplemental_material" folders, there are subfolders that denote the different figures that the data is used in i.e. "fig_2". Those subfolders have subfolders that denote the different subplots that the data is used in. The data itself is stored in .txt files that are named to describe what the data is. The first column of each text file is the x-axis, and the second column is the y-axis.
